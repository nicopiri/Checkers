Here is the assignment given by the teacher.
[Progetto laboratorio PEL 2022.pdf](https://github.com/nicopiri/Checkers/files/12672484/Progetto.laboratorio.PEL.2022.pdf).
player.hpp was given by the teacher, player.cpp is mine.
(play.cpp and verify.cpp were given by the teacher too just for an example of testing, they may not be correct)
