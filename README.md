Here is the assignment given by the professor.
[Progetto laboratorio PEL 2022.pdf](https://github.com/nicopiri/Checkers/files/12672484/Progetto.laboratorio.PEL.2022.pdf).
player.hpp is given by the professor, player.cpp is mine.
(play.cpp and verify.cpp were given by the professor too just for an example of testing, they may not be correct)
